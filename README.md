## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Fidma destructuring
- A lot of Flexbox & Grid

### What I learned

I am getting more comfortable with CSS. The challenges are easier. I am ready to take on challenges with JavaScript. 

The only think I struggle with a bit more is the "billing box" because I didn't have access to the Figma files I wasn't quite shire how to do that. So I guessed and used Grid for that. It was a kind of torture.

### Lessons to remember

- Start mobile first! üì±
- Grid isnt as hard üê∂
- Start learning Grid! üë©‚Äçüíª
